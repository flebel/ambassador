Embassy acts as a gateway to APIs.

# Getting started

        go run cmd/main.go

# Usage

## Built-in ambassadors

Embassy comes bundled with a generic ambassador that allows for creating simple gateways from a JSON configuration file, and an ambassador for the `jsonip.com` service. The `config.json` file contains an example of how to use either ambassador, with the generic ambassador configured to query `jsonip.com`, resulting in an identical behavior and end result for those two ambassadors.
